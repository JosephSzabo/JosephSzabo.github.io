    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Completing the Computer Science program and building my ePortfolio has been a transformative journey, one filled with challenges, growth, and rewarding accomplishments. When I began this program just over a year ago, I had minimal experience with coding and development. The world of computer science felt foreign and overwhelming. But today, thanks to this program and my dedication, I can confidently build full dashboards, create functional websites, and develop real-world applications. This experience has not only expanded my technical skill set, but it's also shaped my professional goals and proven that with hard work and focus, I can achieve anything I set my mind to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the program, I learned that computer science is much more than writing code, it's about solving problems, understanding systems, and collaborating with others to build things that work. One of the most valuable lessons I took away was the importance of breaking down complex tasks into manageable pieces. This approach helped me consistently navigate complicated assignments, debug issues, and ultimately complete more sophisticated projects. I also discovered the power of collaboration, when I encountered challenges, reaching out to classmates often led to insights I hadn't considered. This showed me that there are many ways to solve a problem, and the best solutions often come from teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building my ePortfolio helped me reflect on just how far I've come. From writing my first Python script to developing full-stack applications, I can now see my own growth in a tangible way. Even learning HTML to build the portfolio itself felt like a meaningful milestone, it was something I had once found frustrating, but now I understand how to use it effectively. The artifacts I've selected demonstrate that I'm ready to contribute in the real world, with practical experience across multiple areas of software development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in team environments during group projects taught me how essential collaboration is in the software development lifecycle. Whether using Agile methods to track tasks or splitting up responsibilities in version-controlled environments, I learned how to improve both efficiency and product quality. Collaboration doesn't just improve code, it improves people. I now understand the value of peer feedback and shared responsibility when developing software that serves stakeholders and users alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communicating with stakeholders has also become a key skill. Throughout the program, I was often tasked with explaining technical concepts to a non-technical audience. This required me to break down complex systems into simple, understandable language. In doing so, I not only helped others understand my work, I also deepened my own understanding. This experience gave me confidence that I can clearly explain my ideas in team settings, client meetings, or job interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strengthened my knowledge of data structures and algorithms by enhancing my inventory management app. Originally created in my CS-360 course, I revisited this app and improved its efficiency by integrating a HashMap for faster data lookups. I also worked on batching database updates to reduce the number of backend calls and improve performance. This project helped me understand how the right data structures can make a significant difference in performance, especially at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience with software engineering and database systems deepened significantly during the program. I designed and built applications using object-oriented principles and applied the Agile method when creating collaborative projects like a travel website. I worked on CRUD operations, validation, and relational databases. In one artifact, I connected a Java application to a database through a custom DatabaseHelper class and used prepared statements to ensure safe, efficient queries. This hands-on experience made me realize how critical database integration is for building complete, scalable applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security is another area that became increasingly important to me. Although I didn't think much about security at the start of the program, CS-305 (“Software Security”) opened my eyes to the importance of secure development practices. I learned about input validation, authentication, encryption, hashing, and secure error handling. Now, every time I write code, I think about how to keep users and systems protected. Security is something I build into my code from the very beginning of a project.

    <p>
      Looking back, there were definitely moments that challenged me deeply, courses like Computational Graphics and Reverse Engineering pushed me beyond what I thought I was capable of. Learning to read and translate binary and assembly code into C++ was especially demanding but incredibly rewarding. Outside of academics, balancing full-time parenting while my wife worked was one of the hardest parts of this journey. I studied during nap times, early mornings, and late nights. But if anything, that experience proves my resilience, time management, and commitment, qualities I'll carry with me into my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I'm excited to begin my career as a software engineer. My long-term goal is to work on projects that benefit others, whether through assistive technologies, intelligent automation, or even futuristic innovations like self-driving vehicles or AI systems. I want to use my creativity to build software that's not just functional, but meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      This self-assessment isn't just a reflection of where I've been, it's a statement of where I'm headed. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I'm ready to take the next step in my career with confidence, curiosity, and a deep desire to keep learning and growing.
